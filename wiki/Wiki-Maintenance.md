# Wiki Maintenance

This wiki is the long-form reference for the project. It lives in the `wiki/` folder in the main
repo and travels with the code. Memophant is the management surface (browse, edit, create, commit),
but the pages are plain Markdown you can edit with any tool.

## Page conventions

- **Filenames** use dashes for spaces (`Architecture-Overview.md`).
- **Internal links** use Markdown with the dashed name: `[Architecture Overview](Architecture-Overview)`.
- Every page **ends with** a line like `_Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD — <note>_`. Stubs use `— stub`.
- `Home.md` is the landing page, `_Sidebar.md` is the grouped nav, `_Footer.md` is the footer.

## The secret-scan (why pushes can be blocked)

The wiki is meant to be publishable, so every commit/publish runs a two-tier secret-scan:

- **Hard tier** — token and private-key patterns (OpenAI/Anthropic-style keys, GitHub tokens and
  fine-grained PATs, Slack tokens, AWS access keys, Google API keys, private-key and OpenSSH key
  headers) plus a user blocklist. Any match **blocks** the commit.
- **Soft tier** — assignment-style lines whose key name looks like a secret (password, api key,
  secret key, token, auth token, bearer). These **warn** and require an explicit override to proceed.
  This page is exempt because it names those terms on purpose.
- **User blocklist** at `.memophant/wiki-blocklist.txt` (gitignored): one literal pattern per line
  (personal IPs / hostnames). Lines starting with `#` and blank lines are ignored. Matches are hard blocks.

Never put real keys, tokens, private keys, `.env` contents, or personal hostnames/IPs in the wiki.

## Keeping pages true

The `.memory/` notes are the authoritative design record; wiki pages are the readable layer over
them. Pages that describe code carry `source_paths` in their frontmatter so Memophant's Memory
Health can flag drift when those files change. When you change behaviour, update the memory note
first, then the wiki page — and never leave a claim in the wiki you could not point at in the code.

GitHub's wiki renders plain Markdown links only, so link to memory notes by repo path
(`.memory/decisions/Herald Sync Model.md`), not with `[[wiki-link]]` syntax.

## Publishing

The same pages are published to the GitHub Wiki (`<repo>.wiki.git`); the secret-scan gates that
push as well.
